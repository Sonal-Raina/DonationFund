                Donating is a selfless act, so giving to charity will improve our self-esteem and self-worth.<br> 
                By donating money to charity, we will achieve a greater sense of satisfaction <br>
                and growth as it feels good to help others and provide them with all the essential resources.
                <br>
                 
                
                 As they need not suffer to make ends meet. <br>
                 We can help them to provide reasonable safety and security to their families and children.<br>
                 A life that they can live with dignity and in their own terms.
